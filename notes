What to work on next:

1.) When the game crashes (when someone dies), make it redirect you to leaderboards 
    - get rid of gameover
    - when you run out of time, redirect the player to leaderboards

2.) User Profile
    -remember it will be similar to the way the leaderboards was logged into the database

3.) The game itself.
    -fix the way bullets are shot
    -add more maps and fix the current maps
